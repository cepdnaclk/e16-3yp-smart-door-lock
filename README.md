##Problem at Entrance

People who use doors for the entrances face different types of problems when entering. The security level, accuracy and efficiency of the current lock system at the entrance are some major causes the user problems. 

Therefore by this project we are developing a smart door lock including the following main features.

[^3]: RFID card reader

In addition to this following features will be included in the door lock.

- Unlock record of the current user at the door
- Information display of the current user
- Allowing only one person to enter at a time

##Data Flow
 
 Data from the face recognition system, Finger print detection and RFID cards will be sent directly to a web server and the details of the user will be upddated while sending them to the information display.
